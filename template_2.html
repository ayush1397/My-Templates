						<h1>Intro</h1>
						<p>The Martian is a 2011 science fiction novel written by Andy Weir. It was his debut novel under his own name.[a] It was originally self-published in 2011; Crown Publishing purchased the rights and re-released it in 2014. The story follows an American astronaut, Mark Watney, as he becomes stranded alone on Mars in the year 2035[1] and must improvise in order to survive.[2][3][4] The Martian, a film adaptation directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon, was released in October 2015.[5]</p>

						<h2>Editions</h2>
						<p>The Martian was published in print by Crown on February 11, 2014. An audiobook edition, narrated by RC Bray and released by Podium Publishing, preceded the print release in March 2013 on Audible.com, and later followed on MP3 CD in association with Brilliance Audio. The audiobook was nominated and won an Audie Award (2014) in the Science Fiction category.</p>

						<h2>Reception</h2>
						<p>In a starred review, Publishers Weekly said that "Weir laces the technical details with enough keen wit to satisfy hard science fiction fan and general reader alike."[11] Kirkus Reviews called The Martian "Sharp, funny and thrilling, with just the right amount of geekery."[12] The Wall Street Journal called the book "the best pure sci-fi novel in years."[2] Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a grade of "B", describing it as "an impressively geeky debut novel" but saying Weir "stumbles with his secondary characters".[4] USA Today rated The Martian three out of four stars, calling it "terrific stuff, a crackling good read" but noting that "Mark's unflappability, perhaps the book's biggest asset, is also its greatest weakness. He's a wiseacre with a tendency to steer well clear of existential matters."[13] Amazing Stories commented, "Andy Weir's The Martian will leave you as breathless as if you'd been dropped on the Martian surface without a suit".[14] </p>
